    Use of Bose Marks


3.1. If Licensee desires to use any Bose Marks in connection with the marketing of an Application, Bose’s prior written approval shall be required. Licensee shall request that Bose review the Application, and Bose may at its sole discretion condition its approval on Licensee’s Application successfully passing technical certification testing or other business or marketing standards or requirements set by Bose. In addition, if Bose provides its approval, Licensee must use the Bose Marks as provided by Bose in strict compliance with the then-current version of Bose’s Trademark Guidelines, which will be provided to Licensee upon request. Bose may modify its Trademark Guidelines from time to time by providing written notice to Licensee, and if it does so, the modified Trademark Guidelines will govern Licensee’s use of the Bose Marks in connection with any Applications manufactured or distributed 30 or more days after the date of Bose’s written notice. Licensee agrees that it will not use the Bose Marks in any way not expressly permitted by this Agreement or the Trademark Guidelines.

3.2. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the requirements in Section 2.2, if Licensee chooses not to use the Bose Marks in connection with the marketing of an Application, then Licensee need not submit the Application to Bose for review and approval as provided in Section 3.1. Licensee may then only refer to Bose and its products or services in plain text in order to factually reference their compatibility with Licensee’s Application, e.g. "Bose® Corporation" or "Licensee's Application for the [Bose] product". Any such use shall not be misleading, defamatory, or state or imply endorsement of Licensee’s Application or any entity, product or service by Bose.

    Material Changes; Re-Approvals. If Licensee makes any material changes to an Application previously reviewed and approved by Bose under Section 3.1, then, prior to any commercial production or distribution of the modified Application in connection with the Bose Marks, Licensee must give Bose prompt written notice thereof. If required by Bose, Licensee will submit the modified Application to Bose for its review and re-approval prior to any commercial production or distribution. Also, for quality control purposes, Bose may, at its sole discretion and at any time, require Licensee to submit for review and re-approval any or all Applications in regard to which Licensee uses the Bose Marks. Licensee will immediately suspend all sales and distribution of any Applications using the Bose Marks submitted for review or re-review that are not approved by Bose. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee need not submit a modified Application for review and re-approval in accordance with this Section 4 if Licensee ceases to use the Bose Marks.

    Bose Marks License. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Sections 3 and 4, Bose hereby grants to Licensee a world-wide, limited, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Bose Marks. Licensee shall not use any Bose Marks in connection with an Application until such time that Licensee has received approval as applicable under Section 3 or 4.

    Licensee Trademark License.  Licensee hereby grants to Bose and its Affiliates and its and their respective distributors and resellers a world-wide, limited, royalty-free non-exclusive license to use Licensee’s name and Application-related trademark(s) (collectively, the “Licensee Marks”) in connection with Bose’s user manuals, product packaging, marketing, advertisements, mobile applications, web pages, and other marketing materials.

If Licensee has entered into a separate confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement with Bose regarding the subject matter of this Agreement (“NDA”), then the terms and conditions of such NDA shall remain in full force and effect, are incorporated herein by reference, and apply to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that any termination of the NDA pursuant to the terms thereof shall have no effect on the confidentiality obligations provided for herein. Except as stated in the preceding sentence, in the event of any express conflict between any provision of the NDA and any other provision of this Agreement, the provision of the NDA shall control.
